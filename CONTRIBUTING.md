## Some Ideas

1. Add possible trophies for consideration (but it will depend on what the games look like):

    1. Crazy Rook
    1. "Windmill" trophy
    2. 2 knight vs pawn mate

2. Shareable links

    - Generate a shareable link so others can see results and games

3. Improve test coverage

4. Some way to sort trophies by (1) date, (2) opponent rating?

Send me a message if you're interested in working on any of these. I can answer any questions about the code, if needed, to help get you started.
